///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// \brief Abstract adapter class for PCM-based audio output drivers.
///
/// This class has to be implemented by the actual sound system. In the
/// EPT this is the AudioPlayerForQt
///
/// Note that the sound-producing component (the EPT synthesizer) does not call
/// the audio player by itself to deliver data, instead the AudioPlayer
/// manages the workflow and requests data from the sound-producing component.
///
/// To establish this mechanism the sound-producing component (the synthesizer)
/// has to be derived from an abstract class called PCMWriterInterface.
/// The request is carried out by calling a function named generateAudioPacket
/// which is defined virtually in the PCMWriterInterface.
/// \see AudioPlayerForQt
/// \see PCMWriterInterface
///
/// The present class does nothing but holding a pointer to the
/// PCMWriterInterface. In addition it handels a mute flag.
